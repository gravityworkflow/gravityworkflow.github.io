# GitHub Pages Deployment Branch

This branch (`gh-pages`) is used for hosting the deployed version of gravityworkflow website using **GitHub Pages**.

- The main source code is in the `main` branch.
- This branch contains the built/static files that are automatically deployed.
- Any direct edits here will be overwritten on the next deployment.

## How It Works

1. The gravityworkflow website is built from the `main` branch.
2. Deployment happens via a build script.
3. GitHub Pages serves the content from this branch.

## Deployment Notes

- Do not edit files here manually.
- Changes should be made in the source code and then re-deployed.
